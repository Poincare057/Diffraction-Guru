# Diffraction-Guru
Run GUI.py for an in interactive explorer of diffraction through rectangular apertures. 
Currently, the limits set on the GUI only allow selections in the Fraunhofer Region, but the limits (sxsize, sysize in GUI.py) can be extended, allowing fresnel diffraction as well.
The sliders' (indexed horizontally for x aperture dimension, y aperture dimension, distance to screen and wavelength) numbers are in the following units; micrometers, micrometers, meters, micrometers.
